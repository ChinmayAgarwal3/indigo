### Human **Morality**

“Donot do unto other what you wouldnt have do unto you”. You will see that I go on to describe society but morality is just this simple, its awesome. It speaks volumes and contains the essense, a sutra.

# **Society**

### **Social Fabric of the World**

Heirarchy of the Four.  It has been described by Krishna Himself in the Bhagwat Gita. He Himself has created it.

- Brahmins(Intellectuals)
- Kshatriyas(Warriors)
- Vaishyas(Businessmen)
- Shudras(Labour)

***####* Autonomous Individuals vs Power Assemblies(Collective)**

I think both are true and exist in our societies, intellectuals are more self aware and more of an Autonomous individual with their own indentities,beliefs and views whereas in this era of information, non intellectuals which is like the pareto majority is not high in self awareness and lack necessary mechanisms to form Individuality, there also exists a smaller proportion of people who will never be able to become Autonomous Individuals. The pareto majority then forms the Collective based on irrational thought and speech and in this era using misinformation and echo chambers rendering false one-sided concepts similar to Victimhood and that Merit and inequality is evil, whereas it is a just a Law of Nature and societies as well that with prosperity inequality will grow and therefore goverments are there to keep it in check for the Labour. History has seen the use of Collectives to cause revolutions in power, however the heirarchy has always remain sound because it is necessay for socio-economic functioning.

### **Left(Labour) vs Right(Vaishyas)**

Today the Collective Left is using sympathy to stir its agenda, the concept of **Victimhood**. Their motive is to invert the heirarchy which simply is unsustainable. However, intellectuals have also been limited in history and mostly will continue to remain so in the near future, therefore invoking Autonomous Indivuality in everyone is also not sustainable. Right is required primitive-biologically, and for societies and democracies to function. The Collective Right and Collective Left needs to be balanced, neither can the Collective be disbanced because not everyone can be a self aware intellectual, neither can the Left or the Right be disbanded because they are needed for addressing the suffering in human lives. People need a moral and ethics code and faith, let it be given in a heirarchical fashion by institutions but also kept in check by the Left. The Right and Left must continue to fight an infinite game for the wellbeing of society,economy and democracy. Both their views are right and neigher of them can be disbanded.

Intellectuals find themselves in the middle with no side particularly welcoming due to their cognitive dissonance. I think that in the past, Khastriyas have ruled, now its Vaishyas, In this downward trend, Shudras cannot be given a chance or this inversion of the Society will result in Chaos until it is restored again, the rule should be done by Intellectuals, in this democracy, it translates to educated and middle ground intellectuals who shall shape public policy with facts and greater good in mind, they must curb this inequality and pacify the Labour.

### **What is God? Does he exist?**

I believe in God, I see him as a fundamental emergence of Life, the source as well as the result of Life somehow. It is very difficult to pinpoint precisely, but there is a belief in a Higher Power, which somehow governs life, a fundamental structure/force/power. I have felt this stuff, how Rudrabhishek somehow cleanses you and how intuition works and the seed of all knowledge is present in us. There is stuff at work so basic and primal as well as so emergent and higher that it can only be felt but not logically perceived and that is what ancient rishis have also said.

Moral atheism is Jeudo Christian Value System except existence of God(Jesus/Krishna), but it is unsustainable, its fine, but it is missing out on lot of things. One can only go so far with Logic, it is obviously logical that to understand something so basic and higher, logic can only take you so far and a point comes where one must abandon it.

You can sacrifice your children to God, because what you want for them is to serve the Highest possible value, it is in fact a mortal burden for them and they have been blessed by God to be given that highest burden.

Freedom can only come after discipline, taking responsibilities and surrendering is True Freedom. As a child, it needs to be taught “no” and self-control, it will cry initially but after a while it will learn to understand what is permitted and not permitted and can be trusted to be left free without any supervision, the other option is totalitarian supervision.

### **What is the purpose/meanning of my life?**

To Level Up. **GO on an adventure seeking the Truth which is Enlightenment**. Fill your arsenal with powerful tools and skills. Grow into your Ideal and Judge as you continue to face Life’s increasing challenges and suffering. Remember, you will not be permitted to proceed unless you understand the core of the issue and solve it, dont do it enough time and you will be suspended from the game.

- [ ]  Life is fundamentally an **Adventure** seeking for the Truth, which comes along with the suffering, the burden and the malevolence. It is not a call for happiness but a call for adventure. Something grand and noble, unlike settling down. Do some real stuff, create some real change and impact, go and lose/win and then come home. You are also supposed to see how your values stand against reality. Have you felt that life is a game such that whenever you decide on some virtue or call and then it is challenged almost immediately to see if you have grown a level up or did you just make a soft call. Specially like in challenges of Ashtavakra Gita and walking on the virtues that allow you to read the book. Keep moving forward, its all written as fate and manifests itself in Karma, keep your ears, eyes and energy open such that you can listen to Providence.**Kriya Yoga.**
- [ ]  You have to accept the burden of **Suffering**. Life is suffering, indulging in maya, the cycle of life and death, has a pain attached to every action, even though one may be oblivious to that. Ancient People of the West counter it with a materialistic purpose/dream/goal. Ancient People of the East counter it with spirituality, getting devoted to Christ/Krishna, making everything a blessing, coming to terms with the meaninglessness and suffering with the goal of moksha. The suffering of the world is your responsibility, when you read history, you read history as a perpetrator and its on you. Face the suffering and rectify it, it will transform you towards the Truth.
- [ ]  You need to face the potential of **malevolence** that exists **within** **you** and in this world. Come to terms with that part of existence(you can see killing and cannibalism everywhere in nature). Children are naturally brutal savages, mean and selfish but joyous. Be dangerous, know how to withstand tragedy and malevolence in this world. Accept your dark side, the rapist, the sociopath, the killer, the side which can usher hell on people and derive satisfaction from it, the warrior that can kill for God. Look at monsters to turn into a monster, be possessed by him. Be convinced of the necessity of moral action by understanding how dark and terrible things can get and thats its your fault that they are getting that way. Taking responsibility for the past and future is understanding that you have the same spirit as the ones who ran the camps in Austwitz, and understand that that is part and parcel of your makeup and then take responsibilty for it.
- [ ]  You must start by taking **responsibility** for yourself and then move forward to higher and higher stuff and people and ending with Humanity, the past, the present and the future. The suffering of the world is your responsibility, when you read history, you read history as a perpetrator and its on you. Face the suffering and rectify it, it will transform you towards the Truth.
Using rationality in pursuit of virtue and transform the world around you in doing so, is what makes someone “good”. You have to act in the world otherwise you have’nt fulfilled your responsibilities in the world.

In this world, everyone seeks happiness and peace, unable to do so the weak,unsocial go bitter then vengeful, they see the potential of evil within themselves and hatred for life fills them up, it takes you all the way to hell. These weak will destroy the good because they cannot face the contrasting ideal and judge themselves. They are the true demons, they must be stopped. The strong donot want to indulge in war and lose their happiness and peace, however the evil brings no choice other than to fight, to fight for all that is good in the world, for reinstating the strong in positions of power and authority for the wellbeing of everyone in this world. The strong must fight, they must not selfishly choose their own peace and wellbeing over the wellbeing of others because it is their moral responsibility of being The Strong, like Krishna urges Arjuna. The hero must pursue and challenge the darkness within and in this world and come out victorious, restablishing peace in this world. The strong must fight, they must. Be strong, face and fight the evil in this world and restablish order amidst the chaos, this is the kind of change you must pursue. Be prepared to fight.

Have reception for evil and malevolence. You must be prepared to meet them and face them and fight them, for that you must know malevolence and be able to recognise signs of it.

People are capable of extreme transformation, however evil is compulsive behaviour, they cannot be transformed and must be killed and destroyed for greater good. Blood must be taken on your hands because you are the ones who can take it.

Be a good sociopath, like Sherlock Holmes, have cognitive empathy, know and understand others and be generous and help them. When you have so, you can also judge the true nature of others and their malevolence. Create certain tests to judge a person’s character, maturity, empathy and motives.

Complete this with Bhagwat Gita as moral guidelines, Shiv sutras as spiritual guidance and Yoga Sutras as self discipline and kriya yoga burden guidance.

This is your social-perspective of this world based on evolutionary-biology, multi religious value systems, psychology. This is your core, with conviction and wisdom, clarity and understanding.

### **Responsibility**

I take full responsibility of my Self, all other intellectual facalties, my body and health and my image as Chinmay Agarwal. I promise to treat them like my best friends, however they will also be sacrificed at times, especially when going over the edge and releasing tamas( doing purushartha )

next comes my family and women

then comes my company, my subjects, my board

and onward it grows

I will become the ideal, the shining gold standard. find perfection in the being, be articulate in speech, meet all requirements of yoga vashishtha, be a true warrior, a true king, a true servant and a true devotee.

what are my responsibilities? what is my potential and to what level of social responsibility can i take?

when i ask myself this. i feel that i can be a national titan like tata,birla or ambani. shaping the best decisions for the country. bringing prosperity to this nation and supporting awareness camps, maybe even changing the education system for the better.

now this is what i think, maybe gurudev has bigger or smaller plans for me. for which i must prepare. see to it what preparations need to be made and how to do them. skills resources luck timing etc etc. be reborn anew like a phoenix, be the ideal, be the judgement, attain perfection in the being, not in words or actions.

i want to create an impact but i also want to live, keeping business in balance is a must, let this be the limiit to which i set myself and the goal towards which i work.

what changes do i make? i want to rebuild character in the generation, i want to solve parenting, create awareness, elevate people in social heirarchy, promote and adopt modern technologies, fund research and stop the brain drain. permit flow of wealth from the ultra rich to the poor and back to the rich, healthier work culture, socialistic communities.

Tricke down economics is a lie

Deep down we believe in a meritocracy, we’ve been taught to believe that we live in
 a meritocracy and that billionaires and minimum wage workers all deserve what they get. We’ve [conflated luck and talent](https://section4.lt.acemlna.com/Prod/link-tracker?redirectUrl=aHR0cHMlM0ElMkYlMkZ3d3cucHJvZmdhbGxvd2F5LmNvbSUyRnRoaXJkLWJhc2U=&a=224126003&account=section4%2Eactivehosted%2Ecom&email=QmSfB9RfU1IumvoPGMz1Sbh4L92yuQjo58m1Zg%2Frcp8uJhVbS1Gzr62W2gv8lmSb&s=57170582e63f5d6b09d8157ce0171a78&i=1170A1301A2A29987), and it’s had a disastrous outcome — a lack of empathy. We proffer admiration, affection, and a sense of awe to people who aggregate wealth. But that affection is often misplaced, as wealth can lead to greed and a lack of empathy.

<p>Chinmay Agarwal is a *mvp developer*, with experience creating super cool projects and winning hackathons. His background in *business*, webapp development, investing and networking inform his mindset and tooling choice.</p>

<p>He is fueled by his passion for understanding the nuances of this world through *strategy*, business as well as philosophy and spirituality. He considers himself a ‘forever student,’ eager to both build on his true foundations in business and investing and stay in tune with the latest technology and *tool-skills* through strategy.</p>

<p>His hunger for knowledge and determination to turn information into action has contributed to his most recent success at Sri Sri University, where he created an university *exclusive social network* for everyone. Meanwhile, he vastly improved in productivity by implementing *kriya yoga* and ensuring a work-life balance for himself.</p>

<p>Chinmay believes *mindfulness* in the workplace is key to success - a tenet he lives out through his interests in yoga, meditation, and music. Chinmay is currently working as a freelance developer and is interested in a growth opportunity(70) and some money(30). Feel free to reach out and connect!</p>
